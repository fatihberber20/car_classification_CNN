Stanford Car Classification with CNN

This project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for car classification using the Stanford Cars Dataset. The goal of this project is to train a deep learning model to classify images of cars into 196 different categories, representing various makes, models, and years of cars.

Overview

The Stanford Cars Dataset contains over 16,000 images of cars across 196 categories. This dataset is widely used in computer vision tasks to evaluate image classification models. In this project, we build a CNN model to classify these car images with high accuracy. The project uses TensorFlow and Keras for model training and evaluation, and it also leverages data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.

Features

High-Accuracy Car Classification: The model is designed to accurately classify car images into one of 196 categories.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): The model is based on CNN architecture, which is well-suited for image recognition tasks.

Data Augmentation: The dataset is augmented using techniques like image rotation, flipping, and zooming to improve model robustness.

Easy to Use: The project provides simple Python code for training and evaluating the model, making it easy for users to replicate or adapt for their own purposes.

Technologies Used

Python: The primary programming language used for the project.

TensorFlow: The deep learning framework used to build and train the CNN model.

Keras: A high-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow.

NumPy: Used for numerical operations and data manipulation.

OpenCV: Utilized for image preprocessing and manipulation.

Matplotlib: Used for visualizing model training performance.

Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:


Download the Stanford Cars Dataset from the Stanford Cars Dataset page.

Extract the dataset into the data/ directory of the project.

Train the model by running the provided training script.

Model Architecture

The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is well-suited for tasks like image recognition. The architecture includes multiple convolutional layers to extract features from the images, followed by max-pooling layers to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps. After the convolutional layers, fully connected layers are used to perform the final classification.

The model is trained with a softmax activation function in the output layer to predict the probability distribution over the 196 classes.

Data Preprocessing
Before feeding the images into the model, several preprocessing steps are applied:

Resizing: Images are resized to a consistent size (224x224 pixels) to match the model's input dimensions.
Normalization: Image pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1] for better performance during training.
Data Augmentation: To improve the model's ability to generalize, random transformations such as rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied to the training images.

Results
After training the model, it is evaluated on a test set of images to determine its classification accuracy. The model achieves competitive accuracy on the Stanford Cars Dataset, demonstrating the power of CNNs for image classification tasks.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how a Convolutional Neural Network can be used to classify car images into one of 196 categories. By using the Stanford Cars Dataset and leveraging deep learning techniques, the project showcases the potential of image recognition and computer vision applications.

The project can be further extended by experimenting with different model architectures, optimizing hyperparameters, or applying advanced techniques such as transfer learning.
